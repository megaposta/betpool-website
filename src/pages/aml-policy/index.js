              www.betpool.com makes its network aware so that any contact with
              the customer or player or authorized representative must give rise
              to the exercise of due diligence on transactions on the account
              concerned. In particular these include:

            <Typography>
              The specific transactions submitted to the customer support

            <Typography>
              Determination of the unusual nature of one or more transactions
              essentially depends on a subjective assessment, in relation to the

              transaction counterparty.

              The transactions observed on customer accounts for which it is
              difficult to gain a proper understanding of the lawful activities
              and origin of funds must therefore rapidly be considered atypical
              (as they are not directly justifiable).
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              Any www.betpool.com staff member must inform the AML division of
